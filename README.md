# Elastic Security MCP App

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/elastic/example-mcp-app-security?label=Download%20.mcpb&color=00bfb3)](https://github.com/elastic/example-mcp-app-security/releases/latest)

## Quick Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb62a569-1ef0-4fb0-90c7-587b98fb2049

An [MCP App](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview) that brings interactive blue-team security operations directly into Claude, VS Code, and other MCP-compatible AI hosts. Built on the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) with interactive UI extensions that render inline in the conversation.

> **What are MCP Apps?** MCP Apps extend the Model Context Protocol to let tool servers return interactive HTML interfaces — dashboards, forms, visualizations — that render inside the AI conversation. The LLM calls a tool, and instead of just returning text, an interactive UI appears alongside the response.

## What This Does

This project provides seven interactive security operations tools, each with a rich React-based UI that renders inline when Claude (or another MCP host) calls the tool:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Alert Triage** | Fetch, filter, and triage security alerts with AI verdict cards, process tree, and network investigation |
| **Attack Discovery** | AI-powered correlated attack chain analysis with confidence scoring, entity risk, and MITRE mapping |
| **Case Management** | Create, search, and manage SOC investigation cases with AI-assisted actions |
| **Detection Rules** | Browse, tune, and manage detection rules with KQL search and noisy rules analysis |
| **Threat Hunt** | ES\|QL workbench with clickable entities and a D3 investigation graph |
| **Sample Data** | Generate ECS security events for demos across 4 attack chain scenarios |
| **SIEM Migration** | Migrate detection rules from Splunk to Elastic Security — upload SPL, AI-translate, review per-rule diff, fix resources, and install |

See [docs/features.md](docs/features.md) for a full breakdown of each tool's capabilities.

## Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> **Just want to try it?** Download [`example-mcp-app-security.mcpb`](https://github.com/elastic/example-mcp-app-security/releases/latest) and double-click it. No Node.js, no cloning, no config files.
>
> Claude Desktop handles the rest — during install, fill in your Elasticsearch URL, Kibana URL, and API key. See [Creating an API key](docs/setup-local.md#creating-an-api-key) if you need to generate one first.
>
> For the API key's permissions, see [Required permissions](docs/permissions.md). The recommended Quickstart there uses Kibana's built-in **editor** (full-featured) or **viewer** (read-only) role plus a small companion role for index access — fastest unless you need a fully scripted custom role.

For other hosts (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code) or building from source, see [Installation](#installation) below.

## How It Works

![Interaction Flow](docs/screenshots/interaction-flow.png)

When a user asks Claude to triage alerts or run a threat hunt, Claude calls a model-facing tool on this server. The tool returns a compact text summary to Claude **and** an interactive React UI that renders inline in the conversation. The UI then calls app-only tools directly for all subsequent interactions — keeping the LLM context small while the UI has full data access.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for details on how views are built, how the UI communicates with the server, and key design decisions.

### Skills

The `skills/` directory contains [Claude Skills](https://claude.com/docs/skills/overview) — `SKILL.md` files that teach Claude *when* and *how* to use the tools. See [docs/setup-skills.md](docs/setup-skills.md) for installation instructions.
